Benefits of NodeJS:
1. Asynchronous and Non-blocking: Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it highly efficient and suitable for building scalable network applications.
2. Cross-Platform: Node.js runs on multiple operating systems, so we can develop and deploy applications on our platform of choice.
3. Error handling: Node.js has a built-in error-handling mechanism that allows you to catch errors at runtime and do something with them. This is similar to the try/catch mechanism of Java and C++, but in Node, itâ€™s easier than ever because there are no exceptions.
4. Real-Time Applications: Node.js is particularly good for building applications that require real-time updates or interactions, such as chat apps or collaborative tools.
5. It is Cost-effective with Fullstack JS: Since Node.js gives developers the opportunity to write server-side code in Javascript, we get to write codes on both the frontend and backend with absolute ease. This is one of the biggest node.js advantages as it crosses the barriers of hiring two resource teams besides saving a great deal of time, cost, and energy for overall project development.
6. Great for Microservices: Node.js is well-suited for building microservices architectures, where applications are broken down into smaller, independent services that can be developed and deployed separately.
7. Easy to Learn: If you know JavaScript, you can work with Node.js. This means developers can use the same language for both frontend and backend development, reducing complexity and speeding up development time.
8. Lots of Tools: Node.js has a vast ecosystem of tools and libraries available through npm, making it easy to find solutions to common programming problems without reinventing the wheel.
9. Speed: Node.js is built on a fast JavaScript engine, so it can handle large volumes of requests quickly, making it great for building real-time applications like chat apps or live data dashboards.
10.Reduces Loading Time by Quick Caching:Node.js has made it easy for developers to reduce task workload and re-execution of code with its caching module. So every time the first module of your web application gets a request, it gets cached in the in-app memory. This way, within a fraction of microseconds, users get to quickly access the web pages without having to wait for too long.
